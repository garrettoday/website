# A little about me

I grew up in the small town of Cottonwood, California before attending UC Davis (2013), where I stumbled upon the study of human memory and learning. After completing every memory-focused psychology course, I was left unsatisfied in the application of the psychological findings to authentic educational settings. So, I started taking education classes, where the findings discussed in my psychology courses were never mentioned. This was a surprising dissapointment because we could improve learning for many students by incorporating findings from psychological research into education.

I have since entered a Ph.D. program where I attempt to find ways students can learn more effectively.
